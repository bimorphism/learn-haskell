* Preface
These are just my *personal* notes I'm taking to help myself learn the language.
As such, they may not be fully complete -- or even well documented (compared to other tutorials).

I am also writing them in Org mode since I find it convinient for note taking and I daily-drive emacs,
so your editor of choice will need to be able to display org mode files to view them.

* Basic types
#+begin_src haskell
  let author          = "abi" -- string
  let meaningOfLife   = 42    -- integer (whole numbers)
  let piConstant      = 3.14  -- floats

  -- Integer is like Int but *really really* big
  -- Float and Double are part of Fractional typeclass

  -- Int and Integer are part of Integral typeclass
  -- Num is the base typeclass for *all* numeric types
#+end_src

** Lists
Lists are defined using [ and ]. They can only hold elements that are all of the *same* type -
eg a list of *String* can /only/ hold Strings and nothing else.
#+begin_src haskell
  let someNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]            -- [Int]
  let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]   -- [String]

  -- Strings are just [Char] - it's just an alias
  let aString = "foo bar"

  -- So all the list functions work on strings, and list of type a

  -- List functions
  head someNumbers -- head gets the first item in a list => 1
  tail someNumbers -- tail gets the *rest* of the list => [2,3,4,5]

  -- init gets everything *up to* the end of the list
  init someNumbers -- => [1,2,3,4]

  -- take/drop takes/drops n items from a list
  take 2 someNumbers -- [1,2]
  drop 2 someNumbers -- [3,4,5]

  -- replicate replicates an element n times
  replicate 5 "whee" -- ["whee", "whee", "whee", "whee", "whee"]
#+end_src

** Tuples
Tuples are defined like (a, b). /a/ and /b/ can both have different types.
#+begin_src haskell
  let pair = (1, 'a') -- pair of Int and String

  fst pair -- fst gets the first item  => 1
  snd pair -- snd gets the second item => 'a'

  -- NOTE: There are no functions to get the first, second, third element
  -- of a triple or any larger n-tuples

  -- They can be used in lists!
  let pairs = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
